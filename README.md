## Introduction

PharosDotMoney: The First RWA-Covered Stablecoin Engine

PharosDotMoney is redefining what it means to hold a stablecoin. In a space cluttered with unstable models and risky DeFi loops, Pharos offers a stablecoin backed by productive real-world activity ‚Äî not inflated token emissions or unsustainable mechanics. At its core, Pharos mints stablecoins that are fully backed, yield-bearing, and secured by a decentralized network of Real World Asset (RWA) operators. This is the future of stable value ‚Äî scalable, safe, and censorship-resistant.

## Why Choose PharosDotMoney?

### ‚úÖ Earn Yield Securely with Fully Collateralized Stablecoins

#### üîê Non-Custodial Design
Your assets remain in your control ‚Äî no centralized custody or opaque rehypothecation.

#### üåç Real-World Yield Generation
Yield is produced exclusively by vetted RWA operators ‚Äî companies that generate on-chain returns from real-world economic activity (e.g., trade finance, treasury bills, invoice factoring, etc.).

#### üõ° Fully Covered Risk Model
Our shared security model ensures that stablecoin holders are protected. Agent activity is underwritten and bad behavior is slashed ‚Äî creating a self-regulating, trustless protection layer.

#### üíµ Stablecoins That Do More
Pharos stablecoins come in multiple denominations (e.g., USD, BTC, ETH) and are available in two types:
- Interest-bearing: grows in value as yield is produced
- Non-interest-bearing: maintains a strict peg for maximum composability

Users can seamlessly swap between both forms to suit their DeFi needs.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
